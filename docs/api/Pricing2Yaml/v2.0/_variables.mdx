- **optional**
- Field type: `map`

Define a set of variables to be used when computing the price of your plan.
For example if you define a variable `x` in the map with a number, this
variables will be interpolated in the plan equation, i.e, `x` will be
substituted with `3` so price would be `15.00`.

```yaml
plans:
  PRO:
    price: 9.99
  ENTERPRISE:
    price: "5*#x"
variables:
  x: 3
```

**Libraries support**

<VersionTable
  name="variables"
  libraries={["Not tested enough to make a release", false]}
/>
