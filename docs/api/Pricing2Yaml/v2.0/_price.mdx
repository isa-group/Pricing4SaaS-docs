- **required**
- Field type: `float` or `str` formated as a SpEL

Price of your {props.subscription === 'plan' ? 'plan': 'add-on'} when billing monthly.

```yaml
plans:
  PRO:
    price: 14.99
addOns:
  BOOSTER:
    price: 17.99
```

**Price mathematical expression**

:::warning

Calculating dynamic prices with a SpEL expression is currently under development.
We intend to support this in the future.

Put in the root of the specification `variables` block which is a map containing
variables names and its corresponding values.

```yaml
plans:
  PRO:
    price: "#x*#y" # Result of SpEL evaluation: 19.5
variables:
  x: 15.00
  y: 1.3
```

**Libraries support**

<VersionTable
  name={
    props.subscription === "plan" ? "plans.<name>.price" : "addOns.<name>.price"
  }
  libraries={["Not tested enough to make a release", true]}
